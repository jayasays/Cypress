Welcome to the MD Group Automation Test
=====

The test is split into 1 core task and an optional bonus task.

First you will need to get the boilerplate code up and running, and then you can start writing your own tests.

-----


Running the boilerplate code
------
Before you start please ensure you have [Node installed](https://nodejs.org/en/). You will also need [Yarn installed](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). 

Please follow the instructions on those websites if you don't already have the tools installed.

1. Open your terminal application of your choosing and navigate to this project directory
2. In the project root folder run the command: `yarn` to install the project dependencies
3. Once these have been installed, you can run the cypress client using the command: `yarn run cypress open` 
4. You should see the files called `task_#.spec.js` in the client - these are the files that should contain your automated tests
5. When you need to run the tests simply click on the file name
